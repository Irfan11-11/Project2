            <p>Do you often wish you could tweak an outfit you saw at the mall? Perhaps you like the color but wish it

                your size. The hassle of finding someone to make the right alterations for you ends here.
                Enjoy the perfect fit at Power Sutra in your very own custom made to measure outfit. No more worrying
                about standard sizes that don’t fit you. At Power Sutra, you not only get to pick the style you like,
                but the outfit of your dreams can turn into a reality when we customize it with your exact measurements.

        <p>I bought a sage green poly cotton pant suit from PowerSutra! The suit is stunning and better than pictured.
            The fabric and construction is very high quality and fits us perfectly. It also arrived much earlier than
            expected, was packaged well, and came with a nice hand-written note from the seller. </p>
